I love ReactJS, but...what is ReactJS?


From Wikipedia:

> In computing, React (sometimes styled React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

It. Is. Awesome. The main reason for my love of ReactJS is its ability to create large-scale web pages that can use data and change over time without reloading the page. 

React can do this by creating an in-memory data structure cache that keeps track of changes to its structure and updates the browser's DOM efficiently. 

That is one of the reasons ReactJS is being widely adopted. Initially released in 2013, it's speed, scalability and simplicity are extremely attractive to developers.

Another notable feature of React is being able to write out a webpage using JSX. JSX is:

> a JavaScript extension syntax allowing quoting of HTML and using HTML tag syntax to render subcomponents.
> 

Getting used to the syntax doesn't take very long and its simplicity aids to being able to quickly create web pages and complex apps. 

I've only begun to scratch the surface on ReactJSâ€™ benefits, so feel free to research for yourself and give it a shot.
