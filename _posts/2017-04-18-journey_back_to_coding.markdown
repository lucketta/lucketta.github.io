For me, the journey back to coding has been an interesting adventure that has led me down many other paths of interests, but ultimately helped me to come to the realization that I want to code. I started off studying computer science engineering at a university for two years before switching to television screenwriting. As you can probably guess, breaking into the screenwriting business can be a hard and unstable journey. Throughout this pursuit, I found myself finding ways to code solutions for everyday problems of mine or thinking critically about technology I interact with daily. Having the mind and capability to learn to code, I realized that I should steer my future to a path where I can revisit old skills learned and create new ones that I can potentially use to bridge the gap between my love for coding and writing.
 
This is where Flatiron School's Online Web Development comes into play. I knew that I wanted to quickly change careers, but also learn skills that would directly benefit me in the workplace so that I could be an ideal and productive web developer. For me it was an easy choice and a smooth journey thus far. My background in this area, my love for coding, and my determination to forge a career that fits who I am and who I want to be, makes me sure that I am on the right path.
 
Find out what it is you love, even if it is two or more unrelated careers or paths, and use the resources available to you to find a way to do it.
