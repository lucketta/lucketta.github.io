Second Portfolio Project completed! I'm feeling good, feeling good. From the first project to the second, I definitely feel like I have learned A TON!

Learning how the internet works and how websites/webapps remember users and their information has been my favorite lesson(s) thus far. It's always amazing when you learn practical knowledge that directly relates to our everyday world. I now pay attention to web URL's to see how RESTful routes are implemented. 

For this project (and most likely all the others), I wanted to implement a webapp that I want to actually build for the internet/world. How we watch TV is changing at a very fast pace. I personally do not watch TV on a television. My TV watching happens on my computer, and, like most people, I watch a lot of it. I wanted to create a place to house all of my shows so that I can remember which shows air when, and link to them so I don't have to keep googling the same shows every week. 

By the end of this curriculum, I hope to have the skills to create something meaningful that can help facilitate TV watching for internet TV watchers.
